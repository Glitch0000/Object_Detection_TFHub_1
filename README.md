# Object_Detection_TFHub_1
Simple Object Detection:

In Tensorflow This repository we will walk through how to use object detection models available in Tensorflow Hub. 
In the following sections, we will:  explore the Tensorflow Hub for object detection models load the models in our workspace preprocess an image for inference run inference on the models and inspect the output.
